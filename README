This repository builds a program named ctredactionexperiment which reads
an X.509 certificate (in DER) from STDIN and writes the reconstructed
pre-certificate TBSCertificate (in DER) to STDOUT.


BUILD:
	go build


EXAMPLES:

An unredacted certificate:
	openssl x509 -outform DER < examples/unredacted.crt | ./ctredactionexperiment | openssl asn1parse -inform DER

An redacted certificate:
	openssl x509 -outform DER < examples/redacted.crt | ./ctredactionexperiment | openssl asn1parse -inform DER

An redacted certificate with mismatched label:
	openssl x509 -outform DER < examples/bad_redacted.crt | ./ctredactionexperiment
